# Japanese Colors

A simple website I built in a morning. I needed a website for browsing Japanese traditional colors but couldn't find any, so here we are.

[Visit the website here](https://japanese-colors.vercel.app/)

## Installation

```
git clone https://github.com/weebao/japanese-colors.git
npm install
npm run dev
```
