# Japanese Colors

A website for browsing through Japanese traditional colors. 

I was spending hours struggling to find the right color for designing my project. Then, I came across this palette of Japanese traditional colors and immediately fell in love with how natural they are. I needed a website for browsing through the colors but couldn't find any, so here we are.

Hope this will help you as well!
